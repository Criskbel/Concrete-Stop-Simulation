# Concrete Stop Simulation

This project simulates a mass-spring-damper system aimed at improving the safe transport of heavy construction materials, such as concrete bags, in cities with complex architectural layouts like Guanajuato.

## Project Overview

- Models the damped oscillatory motion of a spring system carrying approximately 50 kg loads.
- Analyzes the time it takes for oscillations to stabilize, ensuring the safety of workers handling the materials.
- Provides graphical visualization of the system’s behavior to optimize design parameters.
- Designed to assist construction workers by making vertical transport safer and more efficient.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy — numerical computations
- SciPy — solving differential equations
- Matplotlib — data visualization and plotting
- SymPy — symbolic mathematics (optional, for integration and symbolic work)
- Jupyter Notebook — project development environment

## Credits
